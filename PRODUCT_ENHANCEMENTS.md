# Product Enhancements Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the enhancements made to the product system, including carousel fixes, schema updates for multiple images and MOQ support, and interactive hover effects.

---

## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### 1. Hero Carousel - All Images Added
**Issue**: Carousel only displayed 2 out of 5 available hero images.

**Solution**: Updated `HeroCarousel.tsx` to include all 5 hero images:
- Cinematic Cake Dusting
- Berry Cake Elegance
- Chocolate-Covered Smile
- Elegant Wedding Cake Display
- Mosaic Cake Creation

**Impact**: Users now see all 5 beautiful hero images rotating in the carousel.

---

### 2. Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) Support
**Feature**: Added support for products that can only be ordered in bulk.

**Changes**:
1. **Schema** (`sanity/schemas/product.ts`):
   - Added `minimumOrderQuantity` field (number, default: 1)
   - Validation: Required, minimum 1, must be integer
   - Description helps owner understand the field purpose

2. **TypeScript Types** (`types/sanity.ts`):
   - Added `minimumOrderQuantity: number` to `Product` interface

3. **GROQ Queries** (`lib/sanity/queries.ts`):
   - Added `minimumOrderQuantity` to `productFields` fragment

4. **UI Display** (`components/products/ProductCard.tsx`):
   - Displays "Min. order: X units" when MOQ > 1
   - Maintains consistent spacing when MOQ = 1

**Example Use Cases**:
- Individual cakes: MOQ = 1
- Bulk cookies: MOQ = 12
- Party platters: MOQ = 6

---

### 3. Multiple Product Images
**Feature**: Products can now have multiple images instead of just one.

**Changes**:
1. **Schema** (`sanity/schemas/product.ts`):
   - Changed `image` field to `images` (array of images)
   - Validation: At least 1 image required
   - Hotspot enabled for all images
   - Description: "Upload multiple images. First image will be the main display image."
   - Preview: Uses first image from array

2. **TypeScript Types** (`types/sanity.ts`):
   - Changed `image: SanityImageSource` to `images: SanityImageSource[]`

3. **GROQ Queries** (`lib/sanity/queries.ts`):
   - Updated to fetch `images` array instead of single `image`

**Benefits**:
- Showcase products from multiple angles
- Better customer experience
- Enhanced hover interactions

---

### 4. Interactive Hover Effect on Product Cards
**Feature**: Product cards now display the next image when hovering, with smooth transitions.

**Implementation** (`components/products/ProductCard.tsx`):

**State Management**:
```typescript
const [imageIndex, setImageIndex] = useState(0);
const images = product.images || [];
const hasMultipleImages = images.length > 1;
```

**Hover Handlers**:
```typescript
const handleMouseEnter = () => {
  if (hasMultipleImages) {
    setImageIndex(1); // Switch to second image
  }
};

const handleMouseLeave = () => {
  setImageIndex(0); // Back to first image
};
```

**Visual Enhancements**:
1. **Smooth Image Transition**:
   - Added `key={imageIndex}` to force React re-render
   - Applied `transition-opacity duration-300` for fade effect
   - Combined with existing scale animation on hover

2. **Image Count Indicator**:
   - Displays dots at bottom-left of image when multiple images exist
   - Active dot expands and is fully opaque
   - Inactive dots are smaller and semi-transparent
   - Smooth transitions between states

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Works on both desktop and mobile
   - Touch-friendly for mobile devices

**User Experience**:
- Hover over any product card → instantly see the second image
- Move mouse away → smoothly returns to first image
- Visual dots indicate how many images are available
- No performance impact (lightweight state changes)

## Migration Notes for Existing Products

⚠️ **Important**: If you already have products in Sanity, you'll need to update them:

1. **Image Field Migration**:
   - Old products have `image` field (single image)
   - New schema expects `images` field (array)
   - You'll need to re-upload images or manually update in Sanity Studio

2. **MOQ Field**:
   - New field with default value of 1
   - Existing products will automatically get MOQ = 1
   - Update bulk items to appropriate MOQ values

### How to Update in Sanity Studio:
1. Go to `/studio`
2. Open each product
3. In "Product Images" section:
   - Upload images (at least 1 required)
   - First image = main display image
   - Additional images for hover effect
4. Set "Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)":
   - Individual items: 1
   - Bulk items: Enter appropriate quantity
5. Click "Publish"
