# 🔧 Webhook Issue - FIXED

## ✅ Problem Solved!

The issue preventing orders from being created in Supabase has been fixed.

---

## 🐛 **What Was Wrong**

**The Problem:**
- Stripe Checkout Session returns `payment_status: 'paid'`
- Our Supabase database constraint only accepts: `'pending', 'processing', 'succeeded', 'failed', 'canceled'`
- When the webhook tried to insert `'paid'`, it violated the check constraint

**Error Message:**
```
new row for relation "orders" violates check constraint "orders_stripe_payment_status_check"
```

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

Added a mapping function in the webhook handler to convert Stripe's values to our database values:

```typescript
const mapPaymentStatus = (stripeStatus: string) => {
  switch (stripeStatus) {
    case 'paid':          → 'succeeded'
    case 'unpaid':        → 'pending'
    case 'no_payment_required': → 'succeeded'
    default:              → 'pending'
  }
};
```

---

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Important: Make sure Stripe CLI is running!**

The webhook only fires if you have the Stripe CLI forwarding webhooks:

```bash
# In a separate terminal, run:
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

**⚠️ Without this, webhooks won't trigger and orders won't be created!**

### **Complete Test Flow:**

1. **Terminal 1**: Run dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Terminal 2**: Run Stripe webhook forwarding
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

3. **Browser**: Complete a test order
   - Add products to cart
   - Go to `/checkout`
   - Fill out form
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete payment

4. **Check Results**:
   - ✅ Terminal 2 should show: `checkout.session.completed` event received
   - ✅ Terminal 1 should show: 
     ```
     Order created: [order_id]
     Created X order items
     Customer confirmation email sent
     Owner notification email sent
     ```
   - ✅ Supabase Dashboard should show new order
   - ✅ Both emails should arrive in inbox

---

## 📊 **Verify in Supabase**

Check your orders in the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Table Editor → `orders`
4. You should see your test orders with:
   - `stripe_payment_status: 'succeeded'` ✅
   - `status: 'pending'` (initial status)
   - All customer and delivery info
5. Check `order_items` table for product details

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Still not seeing orders in Supabase?**

**Check these:**

1. **Stripe CLI running?**
   ```bash
   # You should see this in Terminal 2:
   Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxx
   ```

2. **Webhook triggered?**
   - Look for `checkout.session.completed` in Stripe CLI output
   - If missing, payment might not have completed

3. **Check terminal logs:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 should show:
   Order created: xxxxx
   Created 2 order items
   Customer confirmation email sent
   Owner notification email sent
   ```

4. **Check for errors:**
   ```bash
   # Look for red error messages in Terminal 1
   # Common issues:
   - "Supabase connection error" → check .env.local
   - "Failed to create order" → check error details
   ```

5. **Verify Supabase credentials:**
   ```bash
   grep "SUPABASE" .env.local
   # Should show all 3 keys
   ```

## 🎯 **What Happens Now**

When a customer completes payment:

1. ✅ Stripe processes payment
2. ✅ Stripe fires `checkout.session.completed` webhook
3. ✅ Webhook handler receives event
4. ✅ **Maps 'paid' → 'succeeded'** (NEW FIX)
5. ✅ Creates order in Supabase `orders` table
6. ✅ Creates items in Supabase `order_items` table
7. ✅ Sends confirmation email to customer
8. ✅ Sends notification email to owner
9. ✅ Customer sees success page with order details

---

## 📝 **Files Modified**

- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Added payment status mapping

---

## ✅ **Status**

```
✅ Database constraint: Understood
✅ Status mapping: Implemented
✅ TypeScript: Passing
✅ Ready to test: YES
```

---

**Test it now and orders should start appearing in Supabase! 🎉**

**Important**: Always keep the Stripe CLI running while testing webhooks locally!
