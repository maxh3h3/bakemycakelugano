# üöÇ Railway Production Deployment Guide

## üö® Current Issues & Solutions

Based on your setup, here are the issues preventing Studio and Checkout from working:

---

## 1. üî¥ Missing Environment Variables in Railway

Railway needs ALL environment variables from your `.env.local`. You must add these in Railway Dashboard.

### **How to Add Environment Variables:**

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Add each variable below:

### **Required Environment Variables:**

```bash
# ============================================
# SANITY CMS (CRITICAL for Studio)
# ============================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_sanity_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-01-01
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_sanity_write_token

# ============================================
# STRIPE (CRITICAL for Checkout)
# ============================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxx  # Your LIVE key, NOT test key!
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx  # Your LIVE secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx  # From Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks

# ============================================
# APP CONFIGURATION (CRITICAL)
# ============================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app  # Your actual Railway URL!

# ============================================
# RESEND (Email Notifications)
# ============================================
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=orders@bakemycake.com
BAKERY_OWNER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# ============================================
# SUPABASE (Database)
# ============================================
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxxxx
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxxxx

# ============================================
# NODE ENVIRONMENT
# ============================================
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 2. üî¥ Sanity Studio Configuration

### **Problem:**
Sanity Studio can't connect because the production domain isn't allowlisted.

### **Solution:**

1. **Go to Sanity.io Dashboard:** https://sanity.io/manage
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to "API" tab**
4. **Add CORS Origins:**
   - Click "Add CORS origin"
   - Add: `https://your-app.railway.app` (replace with YOUR Railway URL)
   - Allow credentials: ‚úÖ YES
   - Click "Save"

5. **Add your Railway domain to allowed origins:**
   ```
   https://your-app.railway.app
   https://your-app.railway.app/studio
   ```

### **Check Studio Auth Token:**

Your Sanity token needs **WRITE** permissions for the Studio to work:

1. Go to: https://sanity.io/manage
2. Navigate to: **API ‚Üí Tokens**
3. Check your token has:
   - ‚úÖ **Editor** or **Administrator** role
   - If not, create a new token with proper permissions
4. Update `SANITY_API_TOKEN` in Railway with this token

## 3. üî¥ Stripe Configuration for Production

### **Problem:**
Checkout is using test keys or webhook secret is missing.

### **Solution:**

#### **A. Get Production Stripe Keys:**

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard:** https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. **Toggle to LIVE mode** (top right, turn OFF "Test mode")
3. **Get Publishable Key:**
   - Go to: Developers ‚Üí API keys
   - Copy "Publishable key" (starts with `pk_live_`)
   - Add to Railway: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxxxx`

4. **Get Secret Key:**
   - Copy "Secret key" (starts with `sk_live_`)
   - Add to Railway: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx`

#### **B. Configure Webhook Endpoint:**

1. **In Stripe Dashboard:** https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. **Click "Add endpoint"**
3. **Endpoint URL:**
   ```
   https://your-app.railway.app/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```
   (Replace with YOUR actual Railway URL!)

4. **Select events to listen to:**
   - `checkout.session.completed` ‚úÖ
   - `payment_intent.succeeded` ‚úÖ
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed` ‚úÖ

5. **Click "Add endpoint"**

6. **Get Signing Secret:**
   - After creating endpoint, click on it
   - Click "Reveal" under "Signing secret"
   - Copy the secret (starts with `whsec_`)
   - Add to Railway: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx`

---

## 4. üî¥ App URL Configuration

### **Problem:**
The app doesn't know its own URL for redirects and webhooks.

### **Solution:**

1. **Find your Railway URL:**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your service
   - Look for "Domains" section
   - Copy the URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)

2. **Add to Railway environment variables:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
   ```

3. **If you have a custom domain:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://bakemycake.com
   ```

## 5. üìß Resend Email Configuration

### **For Production Emails to Work:**

1. **Verify Your Domain in Resend:**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   - Add your domain: `bakemycake.com`
   - Add DNS records as instructed
   - Wait for verification

2. **Update Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=orders@bakemycake.com  # Use verified domain
   BAKERY_OWNER_EMAIL=your-actual-email@example.com
   ```

---

## 6. üóÑÔ∏è Supabase Configuration

### **Check Database Connection:**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:** https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Settings ‚Üí API**
4. **Copy these values to Railway:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxxxx (anon public key)
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxxxx (service_role secret key)
   ```

### **Enable Required Tables:**

Make sure these tables exist in Supabase:
- `orders`
- `order_items`

Run the SQL schema if you haven't already (check your Supabase migrations).

# In Railway, go to Deployments ‚Üí View Logs
```

**Common Errors:**

**Error: "Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"**
- ‚ùå Stripe publishable key not set in Railway
- ‚úÖ Add it to environment variables and redeploy

**Error: "Missing STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"**
- ‚ùå Stripe secret key not set in Railway
- ‚úÖ Add it and redeploy

**Error: "Failed to create checkout session"**
- ‚ùå Using test keys instead of live keys
- ‚úÖ Switch to live mode in Stripe dashboard and copy live keys

**Error: "Invalid redirect URL"**
- ‚ùå `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` not set or incorrect
- ‚úÖ Set it to your Railway URL: `https://your-app.railway.app`

---

### **Webhooks Not Working (Orders Not Saved)**

**Check:**
1. ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint created in Stripe (LIVE mode)
2. ‚úÖ Webhook URL is correct: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. ‚úÖ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set in Railway

## üìä How to Check Environment Variables in Railway

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
2. **Select your project**
3. **Click on your service**
