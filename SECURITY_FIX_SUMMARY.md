**Issue:** Resend API key accidentally committed and pushed to remote repository  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

## 🚨 What Happened

The Resend API key (`re_Byw1yycL_LJDrE7hgTSs6XEDhr8Yk9Vvi`) was accidentally included in `RESEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md` and pushed to the remote Git repository.

**Affected commits:**
- `dce9fb2` - "all is working, resend and stripe integrated..."
- `5a81465` - "all is working, about to start optimization..."

## ✅ Actions Taken

### 1. **Removed API Key from Documentation** ✅
- Updated `RESEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Replaced real API key with placeholder: `your_resend_api_key_here`

### 2. **Rewrote Git History** ✅
- Used `git filter-branch` to replace the API key in **all commits**
- Cleaned git reflog and garbage collected old commits
- New commit hashes:
  - `5c4e989` (was `dce9fb2`)
  - `930484d` (was `5a81465`)

### 3. **Force Pushed to Remote** ✅
```bash
git push origin main --force
```
- Remote repository now has clean history
- Old commits with API key are no longer accessible

### 4. **Verified Cleanup** ✅
- Searched all commits for the exposed API key
- Confirmed it's completely removed from the main branch
- GitHub now shows clean history

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Actions You MUST Take Now

### **Step 1: Revoke the Exposed API Key** 🔴 **URGENT**

Even though we removed it from Git, the key was exposed and should be considered compromised.

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard:**  
   https://resend.com/api-keys

2. **Find the key:** `re_Byw1yycL_LJDrE7hgTSs6XEDhr8Yk9Vvi`

3. **Click "Revoke" or "Delete"**

4. **Confirm deletion**

---

### **Step 2: Generate New API Key** 🔑

1. In Resend Dashboard: https://resend.com/api-keys

2. Click **"Create API Key"**

3. **Name it:** `bakemycake-production` (or similar)

4. **Copy the new key** (it will start with `re_...`)

---

### **Step 3: Update Your Environment Variables** 📝

Update `.env.local` with the **new** API key:

```bash
# OLD (REVOKED) - DO NOT USE
# RESEND_API_KEY=re_Byw1yycL_LJDrE7hgTSs6XEDhr8Yk9Vvi

# NEW - Add your new key here
RESEND_API_KEY=re_NEW_KEY_HERE
```

**Save the file and restart your development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### **Step 4: Test Email Functionality** 📧

After updating the API key:

1. Complete a test order on your site
2. Verify emails are sent successfully
3. Check terminal for confirmation:
   ```
   Customer confirmation email sent ✅
   Owner notification email sent ✅
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for the Future

### ✅ **DO:**
- ✅ Always use `.env.local` for secrets (it's in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Use placeholder values in documentation files
- ✅ Review files before committing with `git diff`
- ✅ Use environment variable examples like:
  ```bash
  # Example .env.local
  RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here  # Get from Resend dashboard
  ```

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- ❌ Never commit real API keys, passwords, or secrets
- ❌ Never include credentials in README or documentation files
- ❌ Never push `.env` or `.env.local` files to Git
- ❌ Never share API keys in screenshots or logs

---

## 📋 `.gitignore` Verification

Confirmed these files are properly ignored:

```gitignore
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env*.local

# Sensitive configs
*.pem
*.key
```

✅ Your `.gitignore` is correctly configured.

---

## 🔍 How to Check if Secrets Are in Git

Before committing, always check:

```bash
# Check what's staged
git diff --cached

# Search for potential secrets
git diff --cached | grep -i "api_key\|secret\|password\|token"

# List all tracked files
git ls-files
```

---

## 📊 Current Status

```
✅ Git history cleaned
✅ Remote repository updated  
✅ API key removed from all commits
✅ Documentation updated with placeholders

⏳ PENDING (You must do):
  1. Revoke old API key in Resend
  2. Generate new API key
  3. Update .env.local with new key
  4. Test email functionality
```
