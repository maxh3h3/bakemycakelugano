---

## 🔧 **Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# ============================================
# RESEND (Email Notifications)
# ============================================
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here  # Get from https://resend.com/api-keys

# Email addresses
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=info@bakemycakelugano.ch
BAKERY_OWNER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com  # ⚠️ CHANGE THIS to your email
```

**Important Notes:**
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`: This is the sender address. You'll need to verify your domain in Resend first.
- `BAKERY_OWNER_EMAIL`: This is where YOU will receive order notifications.

---

## 🚀 **Setting Up Resend**

### **Step 1: Verify Your Domain (REQUIRED)**

For emails to work in production, you must verify your domain:

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/domains
2. **Click "Add Domain"**
3. **Enter your domain**: `bakemycake.com` (or whatever your domain is)
4. **Add DNS Records**: Resend will give you DNS records to add to your domain:
   - DKIM record (TXT)
   - SPF record (TXT)
   - DMARC record (TXT) - optional but recommended
5. **Wait for verification** (usually 5-10 minutes)
6. **Update `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=info@bakemycakelugano.ch  # Use your verified domain
   ```

### **Step 2: Development Testing (Using Resend's Test Email)**

For testing during development, you can use Resend's delivered email feature:

1. Resend automatically sends test emails even without domain verification
2. Emails will be sent to real addresses but marked as "Development"
3. **Recommended**: Use your real email as `BAKERY_OWNER_EMAIL` to test reception
4. Customer emails will still be sent (great for testing the full flow!)

### **Step 3: Update Owner Email**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Change this in `.env.local`:

```bash
BAKERY_OWNER_EMAIL=your-actual-email@gmail.com  # Or whatever email you use
```

This is where **YOU** will receive new order notifications!

## 🧪 **Testing the Email Flow**

### **Complete Test Flow:**

1. **Start dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Stripe webhook forwarding** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

3. **Complete a test order**:
   - Add products to cart
   - Go to checkout
   - Fill out form with a **real email address** (yours for testing)
   - Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete payment

4. **Check your inbox** 📬:
   - Customer should receive beautiful confirmation email
   - Owner (you) should receive notification email

5. **Watch the terminal** for logs:
   ```
   Order created: xxxxx
   Created 2 order items
   Customer confirmation email sent ✅
   Owner notification email sent ✅
   ```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Email not received"**

**Check these things:**

1. **Verify email addresses in `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   BAKERY_OWNER_EMAIL=your-real-email@example.com
   ```

2. **Check spam folder** 📁
   - During development, emails might end up in spam
   - Mark as "Not Spam" to train your email provider

3. **Check Resend dashboard logs**:
   - Go to https://resend.com/emails
   - See all sent emails and their status
   - Check for errors or bounces

4. **Verify webhook is firing**:
   - Look for "Customer confirmation email sent" in terminal
   - If missing, webhook might not be triggering

### **"Domain not verified" error**

- For **development**: Resend will still send emails (they'll be marked as "Development")
- For **production**: You MUST verify your domain (see Step 1 above)

### **"API key invalid"**

- Double-check the API key in `.env.local`
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Restart your dev server after changing `.env.local`

## 📊 **What Happens When**

```
Customer completes Stripe payment
            ↓
Stripe webhook fires: checkout.session.completed
            ↓
Webhook handler creates order in Supabase
            ↓
Webhook handler sends TWO emails:
            ↓
    ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
    ↓                               ↓
Customer Email 📧           Owner Email 🔔
(Confirmation)              (New Order Alert)
```

---

## 🎯 **Email Localization**

Emails are automatically sent in the customer's chosen language:

- **Italian** (default): "🎂 Ordine Confermato"
- **English**: "🎂 Order Confirmed"
- **German**: "🎂 Bestellung Bestätigt"

Owner emails are always in **Italian** (you can change this in `owner-notification.ts` if needed).

---

## 🚀 **Production Checklist**

Before going live:

- [ ] Verify domain in Resend
- [ ] Update `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` to use verified domain
- [ ] Update `BAKERY_OWNER_EMAIL` to your real email
- [ ] Test complete flow (order → payment → emails)
- [ ] Check emails arrive in inbox (not spam)
- [ ] Verify all email content is correct
- [ ] Test in multiple languages
- [ ] Set up Stripe production webhook endpoint

---

## 💡 **Customization Tips**

### **Change Email Templates:**

**Customer Email**: Edit `lib/resend/templates/customer-confirmation.ts`
- Change colors in the `<style>` section
- Modify HTML structure
- Add your logo (replace 🎂 emoji with `<img>` tag)

**Owner Email**: Edit `lib/resend/templates/owner-notification.ts`
- Adjust the layout
- Add more fields
- Change notification style

### **Add More Email Types:**

Create new templates for:
- Order status updates
- Delivery confirmations
- Special promotions
- Customer feedback requests

### **Change Owner Email Language:**

If you want owner emails in English or German, update the text in `owner-notification.ts`:
```typescript
// Change all Italian text to your preferred language
"Nuovo Ordine Ricevuto" → "New Order Received"
"Informazioni Cliente" → "Customer Information"
// etc.
```
