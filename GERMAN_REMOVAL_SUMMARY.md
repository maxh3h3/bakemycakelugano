## 🔄 **If You Want to Add German Back**

If you ever need to re-add German support:

1. Create `messages/de.json` (copy from en.json and translate)
2. Update `i18n.ts`: Add `'de'` to locales array
3. Update `LanguageSwitcher.tsx`: Add `{ code: 'de', name: 'Deutsch', flag: '🇩🇪' }`
4. Update date components: Import `de` from `date-fns/locale`
5. Add German translations to email templates
